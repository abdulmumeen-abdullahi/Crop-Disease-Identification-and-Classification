# Crop Disease Identification and Classification
## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Crop diseases are one of the key challenges faced by farmers between planting and harvesting. The cost of controlling these diseases increases significantly with time-early detection is essential to reduce losses and maximize yield. However, manually inspecting thousands of plants is infeasible, especially in large-scale farming operations. <br/>
This project addresses the need for early, automated detection and classification of crop diseases using computer vision. An EfficientNet-B3-based model is developed to accurately identify common diseases in five major crops with high performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall, while maintaining robustness against: <br/>
- Lighting, pose, and background variations
- Intra-class variability and inter-class similarity
- Generalization to unseen environments
The model identifies and classifies diseases in Wheat, Sugarcane, Corn, Rice, and Potato with over 94.8% accuracy, contributing toward smarter agriculture and aligning with the SDG 2 â€“ Zero Hunger, SDG 12 â€“ Responsible Consumption and Production, SDG 13 â€“ Climate Action, etc  through AI.
